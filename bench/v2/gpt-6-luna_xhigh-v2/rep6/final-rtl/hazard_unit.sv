// rtl/hazard_unit.sv
//
// Detects the only data hazard the textbook 5-stage doesn't cover via
// forwarding: load-use. A LOAD in EX produces its data only after MEM,
// so an instruction immediately behind that consumes the LOAD's rd
// must be stalled by exactly one cycle.
//
// Outputs:
//   stall_if / stall_id : freeze the PC reg and the IF/ID combinational
//                          payload (cleared by ID's flush input).
//   flush_if / flush_id : on EX redirect, kill the two in-flight
//                          instructions ahead of the redirect target.
//   flush_id            : also kills ID's own register on load-use to
//                          inject a single-cycle bubble between LOAD
//                          and the dependent instruction.
//
// Latency:        combinational.
// RVFI fields:    n/a (governs validity of subsequent retirements).
